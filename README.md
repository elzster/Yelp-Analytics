# ![Yelp](data/yelppng.png) <br><br>Yelp Analytics Project 

## Project Scope

We utilized a Rest API to pull data on restaruants in four different regions of the United States.  In our sample we decided to utilize the restaurant markets specfically in New York, NY (East), Austin, TX(South), Chicago, IL(North), and San Francisco, CA (West).

We wanted to take a look to see how densely populated markets differed, and if there'd be room that we could offer up information as to what are trends based on Restaurant Ratings and Yelp Comment Reviews.

## Frameworks Utilized:

* Python<br>
    * Pandas<br>
    * Matplotlib<br>
    * Restful APIs<br>
* GMaps
## Getting Started<hr>
Before utilizing our Python scripts, to have our program script run correctly, you will need access to a Yelp API Key and a Google API key.  Afterwards you will be able to access and run through our sample analytics notebook.

## Standalone Python Search<hr>
We have made a simple python script that will run and access the Yelp API based on the parameters that we used for our "East vs West vs South vs North" battle.  The Script is coded with user inputs that will take in parameters and access Yelp's API for specfic information. <br><br>After the information is pulled, it is transmitted into a csv file that can be used for further data analysis.

## Battle of the Burgers<hr>
For another analysis, we've also included a sample notebook of Popular Restaurants in the New Brunswick, NJ area for some of the best tasting burgers.
