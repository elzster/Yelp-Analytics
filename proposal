Project Proposal

Title : Restaurant Review
Questions to answer:

What we have so far.
We have the following pieces of data types
Ratings, Number of reviews, average number of reviews by category, average rating by category

What does the distribution of popular categories look like?

Where does it vary by region?

Based on sample size, where do we find specific trends and popularity in category by region?

By Region, what category seems to get the most reviews?
-Most reviewed in categories.

Geographically Different, Being Major cities, where are the similarities and differences?

What did the breakdown of sample size look like?

What were some of the limitations of the datasets we pulled?
-Limitation of 1000 results by API pull.

Do the number of reviews in a given category reflect linear to other evenly reviewed restaurants?

Do restaurants with delivery have better ratings?

Data:

[Hastags]
[Checkins]
[Ratings]
[Location]

Apis to Use:
-Yelp API

Still need to do:

Analysis on merged table? I know we have a master merge table, We may be able to use this for a scatter plot, mass distribution of categories?  It would be very general, but I feel that it would provide a good distribution of all the categories that were examined as a whole.

We still need to analyze what we're going to do with the price column.  We have converted it into weights, however where do we reflect onto the importance of the pricing? What do we cross reference it to?

I was thinking that we can use price vs # of reviews and also with price vs average rating in a category. I already have it populated in each of the region dataframes.
